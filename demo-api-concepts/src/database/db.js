Instead, the client maintains this information about each resource, which makes the REST service easier to use across load-balanced servers.

Other entities not generally identified as objects are also represented as resources. For example, search results are a resource that you can read or browse using paging. '

It represents each workspace in a simplified format that contains a link to further details about the resource. '
